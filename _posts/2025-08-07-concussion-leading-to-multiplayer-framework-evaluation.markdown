Tried Mirror, FishNet and Photon, the latter being the clear winner for me. All surely have their use case and special places in my heart (looking at you Godot and Blender), however, it is either weeks, if not months of banging rocks together or just having cross-plattform support.

It's not exclusive to Photon, but writing additional scripts that compensate lag or save resources (such as supported via Fusion) are just more stones on my journey. 
Strangely, this sudden burst of motivation came after a skateboarding accident, almost as if the fleeting aspect of life has motivated me to get my affairs in order (lobbies, matchmaking, host mitigation). Also started learning Python properly (I swear this idea came before the crash).

Small update in the GPU department: Instead of instancing projectiles spawner, one spawner is now increasing projectile counts, which a script I wrote is now accessing and manipulating individually. Yeah, I know, it really seems like I can't get enough of dictionaries and their delicious key/value pairs.

Wrap-up of the past few months: CSD was great in Cologne. Berlin was nice. Frederik Pohl (the author) is oddly horny and I'm planning to do a voice model next and to write poems on receipts. Uh, also learning e-guitar and more about philosophy again!
