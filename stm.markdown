A while ago I built an own [scanning tunneling microscope](https://lemonspurple.github.io/projects/update/2026/01/14/hilbilly-scanning-tunneling-microscopy.html). One of the biggest challenges was to gather and understand scatterd documentation and to find the right parts (both hard- and software).  
To preserver this knowledge and make this technology more accessible I created a guides which can be accessed here:

- GitHub repo: [https://github.com/lemonspurple/DIY-Scanning-Tunneling-Microscope](https://github.com/lemonspurple/DIY-Scanning-Tunneling-Microscope)  
- Codeberg mirror: [https://codeberg.org/lemonspurple/DIY-Scanning-Tunneling-Microscope](https://codeberg.org/lemonspurple/DIY-Scanning-Tunneling-Microscope)

The sources that are contained in the repositories are a **snapshot** of what worked at the time and is tested as stable. You can find updated software and hadware in their respetive repos:

- Python GUI app used to controll the microscope: [https://github.com/PeterDirnhofer/tkinter-usb-app](https://github.com/PeterDirnhofer/tkinter-usb-app)  
- Controller board (houses ESP32, controlls, etc.): [https://github.com/PeterDirnhofer/KiCad_RTM_Adapterboard_v3_0](https://github.com/PeterDirnhofer/KiCad_RTM_Adapterboard_v3_0)  
- Transimpendance amplifier (evens the signal out): [https://github.com/PeterDirnhofer/KiCad_RTM_Tunnelling-Amp_v_2_0](https://github.com/PeterDirnhofer/KiCad_RTM_Tunnelling-Amp_v_2_0)
